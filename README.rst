Installation
============

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    pip install riceprint

Usage:
======

After you have installed the package, check that its working by running
the module directly. This will show you all the vailable print colors:

.. code:: bash

    cd /path/to/riceprint-package/src/riceprint/
    python riceprint.py

Below is an example of how you can use the functions:

.. code:: python

    from riceprint import tprint, pprint, progressbar
    import time

    # Simple pprint, tprint demo
    print('This is not using riceprint.')
    pprint('This is using riceprint. (Same unless you add some spice)')
    pprint('This is using riceprint with style.', 'c')
    tprint('This message will be erased by the next line.', 'b')
    tprint('This message overwrites the previous tprint and will also be overwritten.', 'r')
    pprint('This message overwrites the previous tprint and is permanent.', 'g')

    # Overwriting previous messages, like status changes.
    message = 'This is an example of something you can do with tprint().'
    elements = message.split(' ')
    some_colors = ['r', 'g', 'b', 'c', 'm', 'y', 'k', 'w', 'dr', 'dk', 'dc']
    for i in range(len(elements)):
       msg = ''
       for y in range(i + 1):
          msg += elements[y] + ' '

       color = some_colors[i]

       tprint(msg, color)
       time.sleep(0.25)

    # Progress bar example
    for x in range(100 + 1):
       progressbar(x, 100, color='dg', char='\u2587', lend='|', rend='|')
       time.sleep(0.01)

    # Adding keep=True here will leave the completed progressbar in the console
    progressbar(x, 100, color='dg', char='\u2587', lend='|', rend='|', keep=True)

    pprint('Done! I hope you use this package!', 'dm')
